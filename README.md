# GamePredictionsScanner

Built this project to work on my web parsing. It's a simple project that, as of now, scans 3 of the top sports bet prediction sites. You put in a game whose predictions you may be interested in seeing, on any given day, and you are returned with all the available predictions.

For anybody interested, using it is really simple. Once you clone the repository, just bring up your terminal and run either:
python App.py (if you have anything below python 3.x) 
python3 App.py (if you have python 3.x)

You are then asked to put the name of the 2 teams that are playing, and their sport. As of now, this project only supports NBA games, college basketball games, and NFL games.
